                        <p>The third film, Justin Burnett's "Mamie Jackson - Life on Dialysis," is about a woman who's been living with chronic disease for 46 years and must undergo dialysis three times a week for six hours at a time.</p>
                        <p>Mamie Jackson started the National Organization for Renal Disease (NORD) 13 years ago. Her nonprofit has provided more than 60,000 free health screenings in underprivileged communities.</p>
                        <p>"No matter how sick you can be, you can always make a difference," Jackson told the audience after the screenings.</p>
                        <p>Burnett said Jackson would have been able to put off dialysis for 30 years had she received proper care. "The thing that crept up on me was the courage you find in everybody's story," Burnett told the audience.</p>
                        <p>The wait list for a kidney transplant lasts seven to 10 years on average, according to Jackson, who said that many people die waiting. "Dialysis is traumatic for your body," Jackson said in the film. "The best hope for dialysis patients is organ donation."</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Mamie Jackson has been working her way through the bureaucratic red tape of private and public insurance since her kidneys failed in 1990.</p>
                        <p>A federal law helped the Studio City woman, now 51, qualify under Medicare for coverage of the dialysis she needed for several years and for the kidney transplant she received in 1996. "I'm not a senior, but once you go into kidney failure, Medicare kicks in," she says.</p>
                        <p>Kidney failure has been covered by Medicare since 1972, shortly after Shep Glazer, a kidney dialysis patient, was wheeled on a gurney into the House of Representatives where he testified before a committee — while being dialyzed. Shocked that such care was being denied to patients who could be saved, Congress passed the End Stage Renal Disease amendment to the Medicare Act, and kidney patients became the first disabled people younger than 65 who could qualify for Medicare. Today, 6.7 million disabled people, in addition to 35.6 million elderly people, qualify for Medicare, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>
                        <p>Before she had health problems, Jackson was upwardly mobile, moving from Southern segregated poverty to the world of academia. She has childhood memories of marching for civil rights with her mother in Mobile, Ala., facing off snarling dogs and meeting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Her mother worked as a domestic employee after Jackson's father, a longshoreman, died in a dock accident. Jackson and her five siblings, pushed by their mother, got good educations. "But I was the overachiever. I got several degrees," she says, the last one being a master's in organizational management from the University of La Verne. At the time her disease hit, she was a professor at Cal State L.A. So in addition to Medicare for treatment of kidney disease, she had health insurance to cover the needed drugs. But over the years, she got weaker and sicker, eventually giving up full-time work for consulting and buying her own health insurance. "The more ill I became, the more they increased my premiums," she says.</p>
                        <p>Finally, she could no longer afford coverage. She began burning through her savings to pay for the thousands of dollars worth of drugs she needs every month to combat rejection of the transplanted kidney, and to treat high blood pressure and diabetes.</p>
                        <p>What she did is known as spending down — literally impoverishing oneself in order to qualify for Medi-Cal, the state health insurance program for the poor. A single person qualifies if monthly income doesn't exceed $812 and assets total $2,000 or less. With her medication bills, it wasn't hard to get to that level. "Once I no longer had the HMO, I was paying retail," she says. "I take 27 drugs a day. It just wiped me out." Once she had nothing, Medi-Cal covered her drugs.</p>
                        <p>The coverage worked pretty well — until the new Medicare prescription drug benefit took effect Jan. 1. It provides limited drug coverage for people on Medicare. If those people previously qualified for state Medicaid programs, called Medi-Cal in California, they were switched to the federal drug plan. A March 21 report by the California HealthCare Foundation found that those people, called "dual eligibles" in bureaucratic-speak, have access to a narrower range of pharmaceuticals than they had before.</p>
                        <p>Again, Jackson is back to studying her options.</p>
                        <p>She has taught, written, sung gospel and traveled extensively before coming full circle back to poverty. "I've adjusted my life to where I don't need a lot of money," Jackson says. Along the way up and back down the income scale, she's experienced just about every configuration of healthcare coverage available in America.</p>
