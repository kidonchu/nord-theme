                            The newsletters will be sent with <strong>mvj4nord</strong> @ <strong>stop-esrd.org</strong> as the "from" address.
                        </p>

                        <h5>How to Unsubscribe</h5>

                        <p>
                            At the bottom of each message from this mailing list is a special webpage address that is encoded with your subscriber information. Simply click this link to get a page that will remove you from the mailing list.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since this special unsubscribe address is different for each member of the list, we cannot print it here. Instead, look at the bottom of the latest email message you received from the list. You can also go to this <a href="http://stop-esrd.us3.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u=cf737b1673ac72662c67cc757&id=7e8a065dab" target="_blank">generic link to unsubscribe</a>.
